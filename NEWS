=====================================================================

Probably the only beta on the road of the future 3.38 stable release.
Some rare bugs fixed (ghost tiles may have appeared when the grid was
resized during a move, and the icon was missing in the Scores dialog)
and some needed continuous integration works done by Jordan Petridis.

Here is a new stable release! No new big things, only the possibility
to play the game a terminal, for people who may like that. ;·) Great!

=====================================================================

Some command-line options were added: the usual “--version”, “--size”
to start a new game of a given size (the exact behavior might change)
and “--cli” for playing in a terminal. Also, the game window has been
allowed to be resized to a phone screen, even if more work is needed.

=====================================================================

First unstable release of this cycle, because few code changes. There
is just one bug fixed, and also a new icon designed by Jakub Steiner.

=====================================================================

New stable release! Since the last one, the game has been made really
more responsive, the Preferences dialog is removed, and a 3 by 3 game
is proposed; you can also now play with gestures, and with WASD keys.

Since last unstable release, an unfullscreen button was added (as the
application was not prepared at all until now to fullscreen), and the
first launch of the app immediatly starts on a new game for more fun.

GNOME 2048   3.31.91                                       2019-02-19
=====================================================================

Some crashes avoided, notably if loading a manually edited saved game
file, and a better tiles look on non-square grids, that should be all
the things important for users. From the technical side, the internal
representation of the board changed, to make it less error-prone, and
many parts of the code have moved around. Some tests were also added.

GNOME 2048   3.31.90                                       2019-05-02
=====================================================================

Various changes. The main is probably the removing of the Preferences
dialog: the Undo action is now hidden (and a bug in score restoration
was fixed); the game is now responsive, and proposing to change speed
was now mostly useless; and multiple game sizes are now proposed when
you click on the New Game button (including a 3 by 3). Also, the game
can now be played with gestures (and with WASD keys). About technical
things, the application changed to use the org.gnome.TwentyFortyEight
app-id, and it can be built using the Gitlab CI. Looks good for 3.32!

=====================================================================

On the UI side, the migration from an app-menu to a hamburger menu is
done. And on the technical side, the migration to Meson is done also.
Many thanks to Jan Tojnar for his work, and happy new year everybody.
