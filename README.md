# GNOME 2048

A 2048-like game for GNOME.


## **Instructions for Playing Gnome 2048**

1. **Objective**  
   The goal is to slide numbered tiles on a grid to combine them into a tile with the number **2048**. You can continue playing to achieve higher scores after reaching 2048.

2. **Game Setup**  
   - The game is played on a **5x5 grid**.  
   - At the start, two tiles with the number **2** appear randomly on the grid.

3. **Controls**  
   Use arrow keys (or swipe gestures on mobile) to move tiles in these directions:  
   - **Up**  
   - **Down**  
   - **Left**  
   - **Right**

4. **Gameplay**  
   - All tiles slide as far as possible in the chosen direction.  
   - When two tiles with the same number collide, they merge into one tile with their sum.  
   - After each move, a new tile (2 or 4) appears at a random empty position on the grid.

5. **Winning**  
   You win the game when you create a tile with the number **2048**.

6. **Losing**  
   The game ends when the grid is completely filled, and no more moves are possible.

7. **Tips**  
   - Plan your moves to avoid getting stuck.  
   - Keep your largest tiles in one corner for better organization.  
   - Avoid spreading high-value tiles all over the grid.

Enjoy sliding and strategizing!
